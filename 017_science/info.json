  "description": "Adds in the new science pack recipes, while keeping 0.16 recipes intact so that the player may update their base at their own pace. Implements other 0.17 balance changes: LDS change, transport-belt, mining & smelting speed changes, removal of durability and pickaxe research unlock, and more! Compatible with other big overhaul mods and will support 0.17 on release!"
