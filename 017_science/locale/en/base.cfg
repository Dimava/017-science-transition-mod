[mod-setting-description]
017-drill=(Default enabled) Toggle FFF-266 mining changes (removed hardness). This mod makes all vanilla ore hardness = 1 and makes the burner-mining-drill mining_power = 3, which may break modded ore gating.
017-smelting=(Default enabled) Toggle V's smelting changes (https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?t=64219#p392508). This mod may break ratios for modded recipes using vanilla and modded items.
017-assem-lim=(Default enabled) Toggle the assembly limit removal. This mod affects all assembling-machines and may affect modded crafting stations based on this entity, which may use the limit as a form of gating.
017-old-science=(Default disabled) Toggle the old science recipes (0.16), including LDS. When disabled it removes the ability to use the vanilla science and LDS recipes (except SP 1 & 2) but allows existing crafting machines to continue using the recipe until manually changed.
017-recipes-changes=(Default enabled) atomic-bomb and power-armor-mk2 recipe changes 
017-durability=(Default enabled) All armor now have inf. durability (https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?p=384185#p384185). Axes also have inf. durability to reflect the removal of mining-tool items.
017-axe=(Default enabled) IMPORTANT NOTE: It is highly recomended that infinite durability is enabled when using this option to prevent duplicate items. Implements the FFF-266 changes as best as possible. Instead of mining-tools being crafted, they are inserted and locked to the player's tool slot when they're researched. The best mining-tool is used over lower speed ones.
017-equipment=(Default enabled) Adds belt-immunity-equipment tech and recipe (FFF-256). Note that if another mod that adds belt-immunity-equipment recipe is present, this mod's unlock will be disabled. Disabling this option in an existing game will NOT remove the item - only the recipe & tech.
017-lds=(Default enabled) low-density-structure is also used in multiple advanced personal equipment recipes (mk2 items, fusion reactor, laser defense) instead of steel (FFF-257). NOTE: the cost values in this mod are NOT official, and won't affect other mods (contact me if you want your modded recipe added.). Where possible the cost = math.ceil(n("steel-plate")/2)
017-lds-num=(Default 5) When steel-plate is not present in vanilla 'high tech' equipment recipes, the cost is determined by the number of "processing-unit"s. math.ceil(n("processing-unit")/thissetting)
