[mod-setting-description]
017-drill=(Default enabled) Toggle FFF-266 mining changes (removed hardness). This mod makes all vanilla ore hardness = 1 and makes the burner-mining-drill mining_power = 3, which may break modded ore gating.
017-smelting=(Default enabled) Toggle V's smelting changes (https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?t=64219#p392508). This mod may break ratios for modded recipes using vanilla and modded items.
017-assem-lim=(Default enabled) Toggle the assembly limit removal. This mod affects all assembling-machines and may affect modded crafting stations based on this entity, which may use the limit as a form of gating.
017-old-science=(Default disabled) Toggle the old science recipes (0.16), including LDS. When disabled it removes the ability to use the vanilla science and LDS recipes (except SP 1 & 2) but allows existing crafting machines to continue using the recipe until manually changed.
017-recipes-changes=(Default enabled) atomic-bomb and power-armor-mk2 recipe changes
